## Running Contract Test and Mock Programmatically

Please refer to [ContractTest.kt](src/test/kotlin/com/component/orders/ContractTest.kt)

Once you run the test the report should be available at `build/reports/specmatic/html/index.html`.

## Running the Specmatic WSDL Mock Server from Command Line using Docker

```shell
docker run -p "8090:9000" -v "$(pwd):/usr/src/app" znsio/specmatic stub "./wsdls/order_api.wsdl"
```

OR

```shell
java -jar specmatic.jar stub --port 8090 ./wsdls/order_api.wsdl
```

Now we can verify if the stub server is running
1. Open SOAPUI
2. Import the wsdl in `wsdls/order_api.wsdl`
3. Remember to set the endpoint URL to host `localhost` and port `8090`
4. Send the following request using SOAPUI:

```xml
<S:Envelope xmlns:S="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
    <S:Body>
        <ns0:CreateOrder xmlns:ns0="http://www.example.com/orders">
            <productid>123</productid>
            <count>1</count>
        </ns0:CreateOrder>
    </S:Body>
</S:Envelope>
```

And you should get a response like this:

```xml
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Header/>
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        <OrderId>
            <id>10</id>
        </OrderId>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

As you can notice, id `10` is returned only when the `productid` is `123` and `count` is `1`. This response is based on example file [`create_order.json`](wsdls/order_api_examples/create_order.json).
Please refer to documentation for format of the [example file](https://docs.specmatic.io/documentation/soap.html#examples-as-mock-data).

You can also run the same WSDL spec as a test against the mock server.

```shell
docker run --net host -v "$(pwd):/usr/src/app" znsio/specmatic test "./wsdls/order_api.wsdl" --port 8090
```

The HTML API Coverage Report will be available at `build/reports/specmatic/html/index.html`.
